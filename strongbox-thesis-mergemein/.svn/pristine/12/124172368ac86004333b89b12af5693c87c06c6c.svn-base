\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The conventional wisdom is that securing data at rest requires one must pay the
high performance overhead of encryption with AES is XTS mode.  This paper shows
that technological trends overturn this conventional wisdom: the log-structured
file systems and hardware support for secure counters make it practical to use a
stream cipher to secure data at rest.  We demonstrate this practicality through
our implementation of \SYSTEM{} which uses ChaCha20 and Poly1305 MAC to provide
secure storage and can be used as a drop-in replacement for dm-crypt. Our
empirical results show that under F2FS---a modern, industrial-strength log-structured
file system---\SYSTEM{} provides upwards of $2\times$ improvement on
read performance and $1.21\times$ improvement on write performance. In fact,
our results show that F2FS plus \SYSTEM{} provides a higher performance
replacement for Ext4 backed with dm-crypt.  We have made our implementation of
\SYSTEM{} available as open source so that others can extend it or compare to
it.  Our hope is that this work motivates further exploration of fast stream
ciphers as replacements for AES-XTS for securing data at rest.

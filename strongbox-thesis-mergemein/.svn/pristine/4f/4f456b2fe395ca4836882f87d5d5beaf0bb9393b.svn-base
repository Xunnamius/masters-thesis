Full disk encryption (FDE) is especially important for mobile devices because they both
contain large amounts of sensitive data and are easily lost or stolen. Yet, the
conventional approach to FDE, AES in XTS mode, is 3--5x slower than unencrypted storage.
Authenticated encryption based on stream ciphers like ChaCha20 is already used as a
faster alternative to AES in other contexts, such as HTTPS, but the conventional wisdom
is that stream ciphers are a unsuitable for FDE. Used naively in disk encryption, stream
ciphers are vulnerable to many-time pad attacks and rollback attacks, and mitigating
these attacks with on-disk metadata is generally believed to ruin performance.

In this paper, we argue that recent developments in mobile devices invalidate this
assumption and make it possible to use fast stream ciphers for disk encryption. Modern
mobile devices use Log-structured File Systems and include trusted hardware such as
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and secure storage areas. Leveraging these two
trends, we propose \SYSTEM{}, a stream cipher-based FDE layer that is a drop-in
replacement for dm-crypt, the standard Linux disk encryption module based on AES-XTS.
\SYSTEM{} introduces a system design and on-disk data structures that exploit LFS's lack
of overwrites to avoid costly rekeying and a counter stored in trusted hardware to
implement rollback protection. We implement \SYSTEM{} on an ARM big.LITTLE mobile
processor and test its performance under multiple popular production LFSes. We find that
\SYSTEM{} generally improves read performance by over $1.6\times$ and write performance by
over $1.2\times$ compared to dm-crypt while offering stronger integrity guarantees.

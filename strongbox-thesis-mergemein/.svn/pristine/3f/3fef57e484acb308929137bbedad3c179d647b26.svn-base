\section{Integrate \SYSTEM{} Into F2FS}

To provide full-disk encryption, \SYSTEM{} was designed to offer a transparent
cryptographic layer at the block device level. Necessarily, no specialized
file systems nor kernel interface changes are required to make use of \SYSTEM{}.
As made evident by this research, the transparency of \SYSTEM{} is a significant
source of overhead; \ie it is necessary for \SYSTEM{} to maintain expensive
auxiliary metadata structures to prevent fatal overwrites by the overlying
file system. For F2FS, this results in slowdowns of up to $3\times$ compared to
unencrypted I/O (see \figref{microbench-f2fs}).

Instead of providing a transparent cryptographic layer below the file system, we
can conceivably do away with much of \SYSTEM{}'s auxiliary metadata management
by integrating \SYSTEM{} directly into an overlying file system such as F2FS.
This would provide the same functionality as a distinct \SYSTEM{} under F2FS,
but with the performance benefit of shaving down on metadata maintenance,
especially concerning overwrite detection and correction. For instance, with
\SYSTEM{} integrated directly into F2FS, I/O operations can be scheduled so as
to control the location and reduce the frequency of costly overwrites and
garbage collection.

\section{Explore the Trade-off Between Energy/Performance and Security}

\SYSTEM{} utilizes ChaCha20 as its stream cipher of choice. ChaCha20 is not the
only eligible stream cipher (see \secref{design}), nor is it the fastest in the
ChaCha family of stream ciphers~\cite{ChaCha20}. Indeed, the twenty round
``ChaCha20'' is the \textit{slowest} of the available ChaCha implementations,
which include an eight and twelve round ``ChaCha8'' and ``ChaCha12''
respectively. We selected ChaCha20 for use with \SYSTEM{} because the ChaCha
standard considers 20 rounds, but there is to our knowledge no cryptanalytic
threat towards the ChaCha8/12 implementations~\cite{ChaCha-Cryptanalysis}. In
exchange for a technically looser security guarantee depending on the selected
stream cipher, there may be navigable trade-off space to exploit for improved
performance and/or energy/power savings.

\section{Investigate ChaCha20 Energy Usage}

In respect to I/O operation latency, \SYSTEM{} outperforms its counterpart dm-crypt
with AES-XTS in the majority of cases. In respect to energy and power use per
I/O operation, however, the matter becomes more complicated. Though it was not
explored in this research, we noticed that \SYSTEM{}'s energy use was often
erratic compared to dm-crypt and is deserving of further study. Ideally, we
would achieve an increase in energy efficiency by navigating the trade-off space
described in the previous section.
